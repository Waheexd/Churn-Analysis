# Churn Analysis Project

## Overview
This repository presents a comprehensive churn analysis workflow for a FinTech product, combining interactive dashboard visualizations with predictive modeling using Random Forest.

- **Interactive Dashboards (Power BI):** Created and embedded interactive dashboards using Power BI to visualize churn trends and insights.
- **Modeling with Random Forest:** Implemented a Random Forest model for churn prediction using Python (Jupyter Notebook).
- **Dashboard Showcase:** Presented the model results and analyses through an updated interactive dashboard for stakeholder presentation.
